                I started this by going through the Udemy course titled 
                "Build a Quiz App with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript", making 
                some small modifications along the way. The  course is 
                free and offers a lot of great resources for learning how
                to build web apps. I highly recommend checking it out!  Enjoy!
